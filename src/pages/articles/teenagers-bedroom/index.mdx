Designing a room for teenagers is a lot about the right timing - main goal is to realize the potential in the space and utilize it so it'll be able to grow with changing needs over time.

Below, I share a combination of items I made for a client who requested a list of adaptable furniture that can be moved between rooms when needed.

Here are two specific items I especially like, with the reasoning behind what made them attractive:

This is a good opportunity to a share combination I believe would suite a girl teenager, which I hope could inspire you:

**One final tip before you start to plan 💡**

Make sure you pay attention to the personal needs of your teenager, as there's no single concept that fits all - communication is key before planning, don't skip it.

Hope you enjoyed this read, happy planning! 🛋️
