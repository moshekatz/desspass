Have you had the chance to wander around the house, look at one of the existing corners and think about what upgrade can you do? Maybe add some color, plants or objects?

In this post, I wanted to showcase a practical and esthetic design.

### A common case - rented apartment

The apartment below was full of white walls, and I had to add a bit of color, one that would give it life.

The wall next to the entrance was the perfect place, one that can reflect and light the entire living room.

### The color - <a style={{ color: '#4f5b6f' }} href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%234f5b6f&ei=m0sKZIOEJMP6sAeb2YqIAQ&ved=0ahUKEwjDvbvB4c_9AhVDPewKHZusAhEQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=%234f5b6f&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEMgUIABCiBDIFCAAQogQyBQgAEKIEOgoIABBHENYEELADSgQIQRgAUNsCWNsCYI4GaAFwAXgAgAG3AYgBtwGSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQKgAQHIAQbAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>#4f5b6f</b></a>

I wanted to add more shades of blue that would correspond with the already blue sofa - aiming to preserve the existing harmony, resulting in a young, colorful yet meticulous look.

> **Did you know?** Blue is often used to decorate offices because research has shown that people are more productive and creative when working in blue rooms. <a href="https://ajbes.e-iph.co.uk/index.php/ajbes/article/view/152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><b>[reference]</b></a>

### The shape

The chosen shape that fills only a part of the wall, creates a modern look while not overwhelming the rest of the space.

I hope this simple yet powerful trick will inspire you to upgrade your own white wall.
