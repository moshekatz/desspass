Have you had the chance to wander around the house, look at one of the existing corners and think about what upgrade can you do? Maybe add some color, plants or objects?

In this post, I wanted to showcase a practical and esthetic design.

### A common case - rented apartment

The apartment below was full of white walls, and I had to add a bit of color, one that would give it life.

The wall next to the entrance was the perfect place, one that can reflect and light the entire living room.
