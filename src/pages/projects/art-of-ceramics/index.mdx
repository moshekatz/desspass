This project refers to the planning and design of commercial spaces with an emphasis on real life businesses and scenarios.

First, I had to map between the provided space, <b>Shlush 19, Neve Tsedek</b>, and the brand I represent, <b>Studio Davka</b> - let's get familiar with each.

## Studio Davka

Studio Davka is the place for the art of ceramics.
The studio creates functional handcrafted objects to enjoy for everyday use, all hand made locally at the studio.

## Shlush 19, Neve Tsedek

When looking at the connection between the building and the exterior environment, I recognized a potential in the height differences.

I wanted to use those height differences to give the creators and the craft the respect they deserved, while simultaneously intrigue those who walk by.

This is how my first drafts looked like:

## Concept & detailed design

One of Studio Davka's principals I identified was the respect to the raw material, most importantly - clay.

In my design, I wanted to emphasize all of the stages clay goes through, from abstract & raw to clean & specific. The lifecycle of the creation will be present in various places throughout the proposed studio.
