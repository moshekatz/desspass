## The opportunity

This is a story about a client that seized the opportunity and instead of only fixing a leak, decides to add a cosmetic touch, and I was asked to help.

We wanted to give the new design a modern and warm look, in addition to being much more practical and convenient than before.

The color palette is suited to the rest of the house, providing a modern design with a monochromatic character.

In order to create more space, I replaced the large bathtub with a shower, adding more storage in the process and giving a cleaner look.

I hope this project will inspire you - happy renovation! (and lemonade... üçã).
