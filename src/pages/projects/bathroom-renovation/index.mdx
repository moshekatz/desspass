## The opportunity

This is a story about a client that seized the opportunity and instead of only fixing a leak, decides to add a cosmetic touch, and I was asked to help.

We wanted to give the new design a modern and warm look, in addition to being much more practical and convenient than before.

Color choices?

In order to create more space, I replaced the large bathtub with a shower, adding more storage in the process and giving a cleaner look.
