The Urban Jungle is my attempt to rebrand Atarim square.

It was developed as part of my final project for Bezalel, and I'd like to go over the key parts in the my process.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to have Atarim Square as an extenstion for Ben Gurion boulevard and Independence garden - both full with green, flowing in and out of the greyish square.

I first searched for existing positive spots and the pleasant places, and the journey between them.

Back in Holon where I grew up, I had my own personal jungle - A place where I could get a breath of fresh air, observe vibrant green colors around me and just chill out (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379348/#:~:text=Study%201%20revealed%20that%20walking,green%20on%20the%20human%20organism." target="_blank">Did you know the green color has a calming and relaxing effect on the human organism?</a>).

This memory is what I wanted to bring to Atarim square - an urban jungle you can come to, and maybe even take a bit of it back home.

## Concept & detailed design

The concept was to form an experience around the vegetation - a place you can enjoy, learn, or buy plants.

The design will support additional activities and exhibitions focused around sustainability and the environment we live in.

The existing structure has a lot of potential, and it played a key role in enabling the evolution of the square.

And just before the rest of the visuals.. a gentle reminder to water your plants :)

**Hope you enjoyed the urban jungle!**
