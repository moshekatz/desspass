The Urban Jungle is my attempt to rebrand Atarim square.

It was developed as part of my final project for Bezalel, and I'd like to go over the key parts in the my process.

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to have Atarim Square as an extenstion for Ben Gurion boulevard and Independence garden - both full with green, flowing in and out of the greyish square.

Back in Holon where I grew up, I had my own personal jungle - A place where I could get a breath of fresh air, observe vibrant green colors around me and just chill out (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6379348/#:~:text=Study%201%20revealed%20that%20walking,green%20on%20the%20human%20organism." target="_blank">Did you know the green color has a calming and relaxing effect on the human organism?</a>).

This memory is what I wanted to bring to Atarim square - an urban jungle you can come to, and maybe even take a bit of it back home.

## Concept & detailed design

The concept was to form an experience around the vegetation - a place you can enjoy, learn, or buy plants.

The design will support additional activities and switching popups around sustainability and the environment we live in, suited for the entire family.

The existing structure has a lot of potential, and it played a key role in enabling the evolution of the square.

Just before the rest of the visuals.. a gentle reminder to water your plants :)
